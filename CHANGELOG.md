## [0.6.0] - Pre-release — API subject to change before 1.0.0.

- `createAnimation` — timed tween from A → B with easing, delay, and promise-based lifecycle. Also supports multi-segment keyframe mode (sequential by construction with `gap: DynamicValue`).
- `createTimeline` — orchestrates multiple keyframe animations on a shared timeline with `at`/`gap` positioning. Takes `KeyframeAnimationOptions` configs directly. Registers a single ticker handler regardless of layer count.
- `createSpring` — physics-based spring (Verlet integration, mass/stiffness/damping). Dynamic targets resolved per-frame.
- `createSmoothDamp` — Unity-style smooth damp chase with `smoothTimeMs` parameter.
- `createLerp` — first-order exponential chase, single rate parameter.
- `createSmoothClamp` — asymptotic clamp for capping velocity or force.
- `lerpRgba` / `hexToRgba` — perceptually uniform color interpolation via Oklab.
- `cubicBezier` — pre-computed lookup table custom bezier easing.
- 31 Penner easing functions (linear through bounce).
- `getTicker` — singleton ticker with rAF auto-loop and manual `update(deltaMs)` modes.
- `createInertia` - function added for drag and flick or style animations.
- `createSmoothScroll` - function added as a wrapper around `createSmoothDamp` to make implementing smooth scroll in canvas or webGL contexts easier.
